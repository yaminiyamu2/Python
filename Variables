what is variable?
------------------
Variables are containers for storing data values.
*Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
                    Input:
                              x = 4          # x is of type int
                              x = "Sally"    # x is now of type str
                              print(x)
                    output:
                               Sally
Casting: If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
