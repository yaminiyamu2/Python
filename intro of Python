What is Python?
----------------
    Python is a high-level,interpreter programmming language known for it readabile and simplsity.It is created was Gudio Van Rossan,first relesed in 1991.
Python supports multiple programming like paradism,including procedual,object-oriented and funtinal programming,making it versile for various applications.
Key features of Python include:
1.Readability:It clear syntax emphasizes redability,Which help developers to write clean and maintanable code.
2.Rich Libraries: Python has a vast standard library and numerous third-party packages for tasks ranging from web development to data analysis and machine learning.
3.Cross-Platform: Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
4.Community Support: A large and active community contributes to extensive documentation and resources, making it easier for beginners to learn and troubleshoot.
      Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more,
making it a popular choice among developers.
It is used for:
1.web development (server-side),
2.software development,
3.mathematics,
4.system scripting.

 What is programming
 --------------------
 Programming is a way to instruct computer to perform various tasks.

 Note:Python uses .py extension


What can Python do?
--------------------
1.Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
2.Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
3.Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
4.Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
5.Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

What python?
------------
1.Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
2.Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
3.Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

 Who will convert from High level(Human language) to low level (Machine language)?
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Compiler
2. Interpreted
3. Assemble
4. Translator
 compiler: It converts the high level language to machine code in one session (Whole code) Ex:- C, C++, Java etc
 Interpreted:It convert the high level language to machine code line by lineEx:- Python,Perl,Matlab etc
 Assembler: It converts assemble language to machine language.
 Translator: Anything that converts one level language to another level language is known as translator.
